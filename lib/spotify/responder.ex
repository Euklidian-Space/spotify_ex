defmodule Responder do
  @moduledoc """
  Recieves http responses from the client and handles them accordingly.

  Spotify API modules (Playlist, Album, etc) `use Responder`. When a request is made they giv the endpoint URL to the Client, which makes the request, and pass the response to `handle_response`. Each API module must build appropriate responses, so they add Responder as a behaviour, and implement the `build_response/1` function.
